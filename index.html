          <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
          <p>I was born in Adelaide in 1970 to a long line of ANZAC Australian’s of English and Scottish ancestry. My grade 12 high school was completed in 1997 and soon afterwards I moved to Queensland. Our mother tongue at home has always been Australian English.<br>
During the early 1990’s unemployment levels were at an all time high, so I was afforded the opportunity to move to Indonesia where I until recently resided.<br> 
This period was where I was thrown into the deep end of business, learning the local languages, marketing and eventually the birth of technology such as windows and ultimately, the internet.<br>
While not manufacturing and exporting garden furniture, I like to spend my time fishing with cold beers or smoking meats with cold beers; so much so that I built my own smoker trailer.<br>

          <h2>INTEREST IN IT</h2>
          <div class="content">
            <h3>Sep 2005 - Feb 2007</h3>
            <p>My passion of IT would of started around the time of first using Windows 3.1 and 
installing it myself from a handful of floppy discs. Computers and software 
intrigued me and I could not get enough of experimenting. Since playing Duke 
Nukem 3D I began my interest in the hardware behind the computing. Installing 
sound and graphic cards, network cards, modems then setting up LANs then 
eventually dial up servers for death matches. <br />
<br />
Since those days not much has changed. I still am building my own computer and 
fixing everyone else’s computer. I have ended up the go-to guy in our city for 
computer issues both software and hardware. <br />
<br />
Since 2015 I have been teaching Cambridge IGCSE (Grade 10) ICT. This is very 
similar to this Introduction to IT course in some ways, but I am teaching the 
young students about things like fax machines, CRT monitors and ZIP drives. 
Fortunately, I grew up through this era and don’t need to study to teach this 
subject. <br />
<br />
After returning to Australia in march 2019 and compeled my Diploma of Business, 
I now intend to further my education with a Bachelor of International Business. 
One of the prerequisites suggested by the advisor was to take this course first.
<br />
<br />
I expect from this course to refine my knowledge and am already finding it very 
interesting. An example would be GitHub where you are reading this page now. 
Previously it is not something I would have been too interested in exploring but 
now I am finding it quite fascinating. Also, the online sessions. Since 
partaking in these I have explored other platforms such as BigBlueButton and 
have used that to run a couple of classes from afar and it has had a very good 
reception

Principal Data Insights Analyst is a stable position with the Queensland 
Government using cutting edge technologies to gather and use data to create 
usable information for upgrading city management to the twenty first century. 
What makes this position so interesting for me is the using of Artificial 
Intelligence and being part of a team who like myself, not only love Brisbane, 
but enjoy implementing new technologies and analysing and improving current 
systems.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>The salary package for me is only one of the 
things that make this position appealing to me. Working with data and 
manipulating data to produce a variety of information has always appealed to me. 
Building on, revamping or streamlining older systems to make production or 
administrative tasks more efficient gives me great pleasure. Using data and 
reports to make predictions, forecasts and planning I have found to be one of 
the most necessary skill sets that I have.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style5">This position will require someone who is passionate 
about IT and keeping their skills up to date with modern technologies. The 
candidate should have quite a few years’ experience and proven track record 
working with data in the business sector, and the skills to analyse that data to 
make informed decisions on planning. For this position the applicating needs to 
be confident working within a team and proactive within that environment. The 
ability to stay focused on the task and find a solution would be a major 
component of the position. Most importantly, being able to demonstrate 
experience as a team leader is essential to be successful is required to be 
considered for this role. Excellent communication and problem-solving skills 
while working under stress are paramount. To qualify for this position, one must 
be an Australian citizen or permanent resident.</p>

		For the Meyers Briggs Test my result indicated <strong>ESTJ</strong> 
		(Extraversion,Sensing,Thinking,Judging). I believe the overall summary 
		to be very a good representation of my personality. “Natural 
		Administrators, results focused, organizer, logic”. However, I did not 
		see Problem Solving mentioned in this summary and I feel that this trait 
		is a strong part of my personality.</p>
		<p>In a team environment, I feel that after reviewing these results that 
		I would need to curtail such traits as being forceful and better focus 
		on traits such as results and bottom line.</p>
		<p>When forming a team, I should let other team members know that I have 
		strengths in the administration and sticking to goals and targets. I 
		should set out a clear list of standards that the team need to achieve 
		and help keep the team on track to achieving these.</p>

		<p>This learning style test indicated that I am a solitary intrapersonal 
		learner. I would certainly agree with this result as I find that when 
		studying I prefer a quiet environment and to research by myself rather 
		than ask for assistance or reach out to a friend for information.<br />
		<br />
		When considering these results for teamwork, my position would perhaps 
		be better situated in being the member that does the research and shares 
		the information with the team. As my patience is “thin”, I would prefer 
		to get on with things by myself then contribute when I have results.<br />
		<br />
		I would be best suited to position myself in a team as researcher and 
		administrator. This way I could be more productive getting the project 
		completed rather than spending time discussing it.</p>

		<p>Of the two learning style tests, I found this one to be very 
		accurate. That I am a visual learner really does match the way I learn. 
		When listening to a lecture I often become bored and sleepy, but when 
		researching on the internet for example, my mind buzzes along and I am 
		click links and reading pages and watching videos, putting all the 
		pieces together.</p>
		<p>As a team member, like the previous learning style test, I would 
		standby my decision to act as researcher and administrator and perhaps 
		secretary/note taker.</p>

		<h4>IQ TEST</h4>
		<p>free-iqtest.net</p>
		<p>In the past I have taken IQ tests online and always seem to average 
		around the 130 mark. Therefore as this result is consistent with past 
		tests, I can assume that it is fairly accurate. I am happy with my 
		result of 126 indicating above average intelligence, as 70% of people 
		fall into the range of 85-115</p>
		<p>Comparing the results of an IQ test I feel would not necessarily 
		influence behaviour in a team environment. A team consist of various 
		members with different abilities that do not necessarily involve 
		intelligence, but more about skills and personalities.</p>
		<p>Therefore, I would not take these results into consideration when 
		forming a team. I would form a team based on skillsets, experience and 
		compatibility. </p>
